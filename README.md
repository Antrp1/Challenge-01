## Horiseon Webpage

- The webpage was passed to me to get some enhancements.
- I worked on this project because it was bland and not appealing to the eye.
- This solved viewers interest once accessing the webpage.
- I learned that not every developer thinks the same, and there are multiple different ways to apply the same code.
